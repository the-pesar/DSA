# Linked list

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected through pointers. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for dynamic size adjustment and efficient insertion or deletion of elements. There are various types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists (nodes point to the next node only), doubly linked lists (nodes point to both next and previous nodes), and circular linked lists (last node points back to the first).

# Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

## Examples

### Example 1

**input**:
`s = "abcd", t = "abcde"` 
**output**:
`e`

### Example 2 

**input**:
`s = "", t = "y"` 
**output**:
`y`

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= `s.length` <= 1000
- `t.length` == `s.length` + 1
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
